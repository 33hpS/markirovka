## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### DO NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@company.com](mailto:security@company.com)
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 7-14 days (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and verified

## Security Measures

### Frontend Security

- **XSS Protection**: DOMPurify sanitization for all user inputs
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for client-side validation
- **Secure Headers**: Content Security Policy and security headers
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT token handling with auto-refresh

### Data Protection

- **Local Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted before storage
- **API Communication**: HTTPS only in production
- **Token Management**: Secure storage and automatic expiration
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized and validated

### Build Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular `npm audit` checks
- **Code Analysis**: ESLint security rules enabled
- **Secret Detection**: Pre-commit hooks for secret scanning
- **Supply Chain**: Verified dependencies and lock files

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Authentication**: Use secure authentication methods
3. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
4. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and audited
5. **Secrets**: Never commit secrets or credentials

### For Users

1. **Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords
2. **Sessions**: Log out when finished
3. **Updates**: Keep the application updated
4. **Browsers**: Use updated, secure browsers

## Security Controls

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with secure storage
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session timeout and automatic refresh
- Secure password requirements

### Data Validation

- Client-side validation with Zod schemas
- Server-side validation (when backend is implemented)
- Input sanitization with DOMPurify
- File upload restrictions and validation

### Network Security

- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Secure API endpoints
- Rate limiting (when implemented)
- CORS configuration

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1**: Acknowledgment sent
3. **Day 3**: Initial assessment completed
4. **Day 7-14**: Fix developed and tested
5. **Day 15**: Fix deployed to production
6. **Day 16**: Public disclosure (if appropriate)

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1)
- Documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Announced via GitHub releases
- Applied automatically in CI/CD pipeline

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Security Team**: security@company.com
